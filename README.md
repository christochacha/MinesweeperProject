# MinesweeperProject
This project is a remake of the classic game Minesweeper. I created this project to learn about GUI (more specifically JavaSwing).
When playing, note that there is a timer at the top left that tracks how long it takes for you to sweep all of the mines as well as a counter that tracks how many mines you have swept/how many you have left to sweep.
Left click to uncover a cell and right click to mark a mine.
Good luck!
